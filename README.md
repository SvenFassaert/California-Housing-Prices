This project involves using machine learning techniques to predict house prices in California. It is designed to enhance and refine my data science skills through practical application. By employing various machine learning algorithms and models, this project aims to develop accurate predictive models for real estate valuation. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation. Overall, this project serves as both a learning experience and a demonstration of my capabilities in data science.
